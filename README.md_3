Task 1 – Data Redundancy Removal System

This is Task 1 of the CodeAlpha Internship – a simple Python program that removes duplicate data from a list and provides a cleaned version of the combined dataset.
Objective:

To create a Python-based system that detects and removes redundant (duplicate) data from datasets.
 How It Works

- Two lists are provided: old data and new data.
- The program combines both.
- A function remove_duplicates() removes any repeating elements.
- The final cleaned and verified data is displayed.

Technologies Used
- Python (Core programming)

Sample Output.                               
`python
Old data: ["apple", "banana", "apple"]
New data: ["banana", "kiwi", "apple"]
Cleaned and Verified Data:
['apple', 'banana', 'kiwi']


Task3:
cloud_Based Bus Pass Booking System
This project was built as part of the CodeAlpha Internship (July 2025).

It is a simple web application where users can book bus passes by entering their name, route, and travel date. The submitted data is stored securely in a cloud database using MongoDB Atlas. The application is built using Python and Flask and deployed online using Render.
 Technologies Used

- Python (Flask framework)
- MongoDB Atlas (Cloud NoSQL database)
- Render.com (Cloud hosting)
- GitHub (Version control)

Features:

- Simple and responsive form for booking bus passes
- Data is stored in a secure cloud database (MongoDB)
- Flask handles backend form processing
- Deployed live using Render.com
